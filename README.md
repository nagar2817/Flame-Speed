# Flame-Speed
* Instead of traditional matlab software, we use different ML techniques and
Neural Network algorithms for Laminar Burning Speed estimation.
* Multiple Deep Neural Network models for predicting LBV values were
developed and validated. Also compared different Machine learning algorithms.
* We studied the effect of training database by changing the size and dimension.
* Tech Stack :- IC Engine,Machine Learning, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
